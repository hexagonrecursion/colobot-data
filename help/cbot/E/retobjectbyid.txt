\b;Instruction \c;retobjectbyid\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c; retobjectbyid ( id );\n;

If you know an id of an object, you can use retobjectbyid to get the object:
\c;
\s; object obj1 = ...;
\s; int id = obj1.id;
\s; object obj2 = retobjectbyid(id);  // Same as obj1
\n;

Unlike a variable of type \c;\l;object\u cbot\object;\n;, an id can be communicated via a \c;\l;file\u cbot\file;\n; or an \c;\l;ExchangePost\u object\exchange;.

\t;id: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
The id of the object. The id of an object never changes. The ids of destroyed objects are not reused.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;object\u cbot\object;\n;
The object with the given id or \c;\l;null\u cbot\null;\n; if there is no such object.
