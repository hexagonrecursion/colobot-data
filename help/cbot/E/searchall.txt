\b;Instruction \c;searchall\n;
\c;searchall\n; is an enhancement of the \c;\l;search\u cbot\search;()\n; instruction -- it detects all objects matching the given criteria.

\b;For specialists
\t;Syntax:
\s;\c;searchall ( category, center, min, max, sens, filter );\n;

The instruction works generally the same as the \c;\l;search\u cbot\search;();\n; instruction with the only difference being that it returns an \l;array\u cbot\array; of \l;objects\u cbot\object; instead of one object. If no object is found, an empty array (\c;\l;null\u cbot\null;\n;) is returned.

The order of objects in the returned array is sorted by distance and depends on the \c;sens\n; parameter. The first object in the array is the object which would be returned by the \c;search();\n; function called with the exactly same parameters.
