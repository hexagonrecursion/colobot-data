\b;Instruction \c;retobject\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;retobject ( number );\n;

Sometimes an object is hidden from the radar() and search() instructions (e.g. by proxyActivate=1). retobject() can be used to get any object - even the hidden ones. Here is how to get all objects:
\c;
\s; object result[];
\s; for(int i = 0; retobject(i) != null; ++i)
\s; {
\s;     result[i] = retobject(i);
\s; }
\n;

\t;number: \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;
Number of the object, between 0 and n. "n" represents the total number of objects in the scene.
Note: two retobject() calls with the same number are only guaranteed to return the same object if no objects were created or destroyed between them.

\t;Return value: \c;\l;object\u cbot\object;\n;
Object corresponding to the number. The return value \c;\l;null\u cbot\null;\n; means that no object corresponds to this number, because the number was too high, and there are not so many objects in the scene.
